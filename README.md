Hopper Disassembler Scripts
===========================

A repository for my Hopper Disassembler scripts. They are not really
"production quality" by any standard, rather just quick hacks to get
the job done and probably untested on anything else than the one case
I wrote each script for.

Install by placing them in: `~/Library/Application Support/Hopper/Scripts`

Distribute freely, use at your own risk only.
